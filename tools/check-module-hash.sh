# The read goes through dfx, which verifies the IC certificate (subnet BLS

# boundary node cannot spoof it. What this does NOT do is replay-bound the
# certificate timestamp; for a scheduled monitor whose only question is
# "did the hash change", dfx verification is sufficient. Same script as
# ic-git.

# Exit codes mirror tools/reproducible-build.sh: 0 match, 1 mismatch, 2 usage
# (no record), 3 the on-chain hash could not be read, which is NOT a mismatch.
