#   tools/reproducible-build.sh            build natively (host dfx), print sha256
#   tools/reproducible-build.sh --docker   build in the pinned container (portable);
#                                          exports target/reproducible/name_canister-<commit>.wasm
#   tools/reproducible-build.sh --check    also diff the result vs the IC module hash
#   tools/reproducible-build.sh --allow-dirty  build a tree with uncommitted edits
#
# The IC module hash is the sha256 of the deployed wasm module, so a matching
# sha256 here means the running code is byte-identical to this tree -- verified
# from the IC's own certified state, without trusting the deployer.
#
# For a real third-party verification use --docker (fixes the toolchain, dfx
# version, platform, and every path baked into the wasm); the native path is a
# convenience that is only meaningful when the host already matches
# rust-toolchain.toml + dfx 0.31.0. Either way, build through this script: it
# applies the --remap-path-prefix mapping that makes the hash machine-
# independent, which a bare `dfx build` does not.
#
# Exit codes: 0 match (or no --check), 1 mismatch, 2 usage, 3 could not read
# the on-chain hash (which is NOT a mismatch and must not be reported as one).
